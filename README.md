# STEM_for_creatives_FINAL_ASSESMENTS 

<h3> INTRODUCTION  </h3>
  
This repository contains the solutions to the weekly assignments for the STEM for Creative class at the Creative Computing Institute at the University of the Arts London 2022/2023. 
The three weekly assignments has all been solved using Python and a variety of chosen Python libraries in VS Code, as Jupyter Notebook kept causing unresolved trouble. 

<h3> ASSIGNMENT 1 </h3>

Started working on this assignment in Jupyter Notebook, but it kept crashing so I went on the use VS Code, which is what I usually use and which I like better. 
Mostly questions on data and data processing. 

<h3> ASSIGNMENT 3 </h3>
The third assignment was a test in experiment design. I am testing to see if people who watch inspiring stuff on a platform like TikTok will see an increase in how well they perform in front of a crowd. The experiment is planned as a T-Test and the hypothesis is: Poetic writers who have been watching inspiring videos on TikTok right before performing in front of a crowd gets less nervous on stage.
