# STEM_for_creatives_FINAL_ASSESMENTS 

<h3> INTRODUCTION  </h3>
  
This repository contains the solutions to the weekly assignments for the STEM for Creative class at the Creative Computing Institute at the University of the Arts London 2022/2023. 
The three weekly assignments has all been solved using Python and a variety of chosen Python libraries in VS Code, as Jupyter Notebook kept causing unresolved trouble. 


<h3> ASSIGNMENT 1 </h3>

Started working on this assignment in Jupyter Notebook, but it kept crashing so I went on the use VS Code, which is what I usually use and which I like better. 
Mostly questions on data and data processing.
